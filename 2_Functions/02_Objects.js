 Q. What is this?âœ…       

ðŸš€(not a variable)(is a Keyword)(cannot change the value of this)(refers to global object)

ðŸš€In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.
Which object depends on how this is being invoked (used or called).

ðŸš€The this keyword refers to different objects depending on how it is used:

ðŸ“ŒIn an object method, this refers to the object.
ðŸ“ŒAlone, this refers to the global object.
ðŸ“ŒIn a function, this refers to the global object.
ðŸ“ŒIn a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
ðŸ“ŒIn an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
ðŸ“ŒMethods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.
